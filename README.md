# AdventureGame
A C++ text-based adventure game

The text-based adventure game is an opportunity to display understanding of coding practices and implementations. Based on a college project, I revamped and improved upon my existing files. A simple but functional model of a text-based adventure.

## Getting Started
Simply navigate to the directory and use the provided makefile. This will produce a file called "Game" which is the executable used to run the game. 

You begin in the fort and are able to navigate through the rooms via directions provided by each room.
